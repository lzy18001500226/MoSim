# Configuration

## MCP Client Configuration

The easiest way to configure UE-MCP is to run `npx ue-mcp init` — it detects your MCP clients and writes the config automatically.

### Manual Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ue-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["ue-mcp", "C:/path/to/MyGame.uproject"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Where to Put This

| Client | Config File |
|--------|-------------|
| Claude Code | `.mcp.json` in project root, or `~/.claude/` global config |
| Claude Desktop | `claude_desktop_config.json` |
| Cursor | `mcp.json` in `.cursor/` or project root |

### Without a Project Path

You can start the server without a `.uproject` argument. It will run in a limited mode — you can then use `project(action="set_project", projectPath="...")` at runtime to attach to a project.

## Project Configuration (`ue-mcp.yml`)

Project-level config lives under the `ue-mcp:` block at the top of `ue-mcp.yml`, next to your `.uproject`. The file is meant to be tracked in git so every collaborator sees the same project surface. `npx ue-mcp init` creates and maintains it for you, but hand-editing is fine — there's nothing in it the server treats as opaque machine state.

```yaml
ue-mcp:
  version: 1
  contentRoots:
    - /Game/
    - /MyPlugin/
  disable:
    - gas
    - networking
  http:
    enabled: false

tasks: {}
flows: {}
plugins: []
```

!!! info "User-machine state"
    Anything that varies per machine (e.g. the list of absolute paths to Claude Code settings files where the feedback hook was installed) lives in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`, **not** in the project tree. The user-state file is maintained automatically by `npx ue-mcp init` / `npx ue-mcp uninstall-hooks`; you shouldn't need to touch it.

!!! tip "Migrating from older versions"
    - Pre-1.0.29 used `.ue-mcp.json` for the project config.
    - 1.0.29 briefly introduced `ue-mcp.local.yml` for user-machine state, then moved that state to `~/.ue-mcp/state.json` in 1.0.30.

    On first load after upgrade, the server detects either legacy file and migrates the contents (project fields → `ue-mcp.yml`, machine state → `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`) automatically, then deletes the legacy file. You don't need to do anything.

### `ue-mcp:` block options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `version` | `1` | `1` | Schema version; required. Set automatically by init. |
| `contentRoots` | `string[]` | `["/Game/"]` | Content paths to search when using `asset(action="search")`. Add plugin content roots here if your project uses plugins with their own assets. |
| `disable` | `string[]` | `[]` | Tool categories to disable. Disabled categories are not registered with the MCP server, reducing context noise for the AI. Use `"feedback"` here to opt out of the feedback tool entirely. |
| `http` | `object` | `undefined` (HTTP server off) | Optional REST surface for the flow engine. Object with `enabled` (bool), `port` (default `7723`), `host` (default `127.0.0.1`). When `enabled: true`, the MCP server also serves `GET /flows`, `GET /flows/<name>/plan`, `POST /flows/<name>/run`, and the Server-Sent Events stream at `GET /flows/events` (live per-step lifecycle events; see [Live Observation](flows.md#live-observation-sse)) over HTTP so external tools can drive and observe flows without an MCP client. |

The feedback approval mode (`interactive` / `auto-approve` / `defer`) is intentionally **not** in `ue-mcp.yml` — it varies per developer and per machine, so it lives in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json` and is managed with `npx ue-mcp feedback mode ...` or the `UE_MCP_FEEDBACK_MODE` env var. See [Feedback → modes](feedback.md#feedback-modes).

### User-machine state (`~/.ue-mcp/`)

Machine-specific state that ue-mcp commands write but you wouldn't hand-edit lives under `~/.ue-mcp/`:

| Path | What |
|------|------|
| `~/.ue-mcp/state.json` | Two things: (a) per-project `installedHooks` — absolute paths of every Claude Code `settings.json` where ue-mcp installed the feedback PostToolUse hook, keyed by absolute project root; (b) `preferences.feedback.mode` — your personal default for the feedback approval mode (`interactive` / `auto-approve` / `defer`). Maintained by `npx ue-mcp init`, `npx ue-mcp uninstall-hooks`, and `npx ue-mcp feedback mode`. |
| `~/.ue-mcp/auth.json` | Cached GitHub OAuth token for `feedback(submit)` author=user mode. Mode 600. Written by `npx ue-mcp auth`. |
| `~/.ue-mcp/pending-feedback/<id>.json` | Submissions captured while `feedback mode` is `defer`. Acted on with `npx ue-mcp feedback list/approve/discard`. |

These files never need to be in your project tree or in version control.

## Plugins

The `plugins:` array in **`ue-mcp.yml`** declares npm packages that inject new actions into existing built-in categories. The full author contract lives in [Plugins](plugins.md); this is the consumer view.

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin
  - name: ue-mcp-plugin-my-other-thing
    version: "0.2.x"        # optional - npm semver range
```

At server start, ue-mcp resolves each entry against the project's `node_modules/`, validates the plugin manifest, and merges its injected actions into the host category tools. Stay-on-disk facts:

- The package must already be installed under `<project>/node_modules/`. Use `ue-mcp plugin install <name>` to add an entry **and** run `npm install --save` in one step.
- Plugins are loaded only when the server boots — edit the array and restart your MCP client (`/mcp` in Claude Code).
- A plugin that fails validation is skipped with a loud warning. Other plugins keep loading; the host tools are never partially mutated.
- Use the `plugins` tool to introspect the loaded set:
  - `plugins(action="list")` — name, version, prefix, status, injected count, host UE plugin presence.
  - `plugins(action="describe", name="<package>")` — full detail including injected actions, knowledge files, and flows.

Order matters: earlier entries win on inter-plugin action-name collisions. A plugin action can never overwrite a built-in.

### Host UE plugin dependencies

A plugin can declare `uePluginDependency: <PluginName>` in its `ue-mcp.plugin.yml`. The MCP server checks the project's `.uproject` for `Plugins[].Name == "<PluginName>"` and exposes the result as `uePluginPresent` in `plugins(action="list")`. The npm side loads regardless — the flag is a signal that the host UE plugin needs to be enabled before the injected actions will actually run.

For example, `ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin` declares `uePluginDependency: Voxel`. Until `Voxel` is added to `<Project>.uproject`'s `Plugins` array (and the C++ modules are built), `voxel_build_scatter_graph` is loaded but will fail at execute time.

## Bridge Connection

The C++ plugin listens on **`ws://localhost:9877`** (currently hardcoded). The MCP server auto-connects on startup and reconnects every 15 seconds if the connection drops.

### Connection States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **Connected** | Bridge is active, all tools available |
| **Disconnected** | Editor not running or plugin not loaded. Filesystem tools still work (INI parsing, C++ headers, asset listing) |
| **Reconnecting** | Connection lost, auto-retry in progress |

Check the current state with `project(action="get_status")`.

## Plugin Deployment

On first run with a project path, the server automatically:

1. Copies `plugin/ue_mcp_bridge/` → `<Project>/Plugins/UE_MCP_Bridge/`
2. Adds `UE_MCP_Bridge` to the `.uproject` plugins list
3. Enables `PythonScriptPlugin` if not already enabled (needed for `execute_python` escape hatch)

The plugin is editor-only and has no runtime footprint.

### Plugin Dependencies

The C++ bridge plugin enables these UE plugins (adding them to `.uproject` if missing):

- `PythonScriptPlugin` — for `editor(action="execute_python")`
- `EnhancedInput` — for input action/mapping creation
- `GameplayAbilities` — for GAS tools
- `Niagara` — for VFX tools
- `PCG` — for procedural generation tools

## CLI Subcommands

`npx ue-mcp` exposes a few utility subcommands beyond the default MCP server entry:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `npx ue-mcp init` | Interactive setup wizard. Deploys the C++ bridge plugin, writes MCP client configs, scaffolds `ue-mcp.yml`, optionally installs Claude Code skills + feedback prompt hook, optionally runs the GitHub OAuth device flow. Migrates any legacy `.ue-mcp.json` / `ue-mcp.local.yml` it finds. |
| `npx ue-mcp update` | Re-deploy the C++ bridge plugin to the project. Use after a ue-mcp version bump. |
| `npx ue-mcp auth` | Run the GitHub device flow standalone so `feedback(submit)` can author issues as your real GitHub user. Same step that lives inside `init`; use this if you skipped it at init time. |
| `npx ue-mcp uninstall-hooks` | Remove the feedback PostToolUse hook from every Claude Code settings file recorded for this project in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`. |
| `npx ue-mcp feedback mode [<mode>]` | Read or set your personal feedback approval mode (`interactive`, `auto-approve`, or `defer`). Stored in `~/.ue-mcp/state.json`. See [Feedback → modes](feedback.md#feedback-modes). |
| `npx ue-mcp feedback list \| show \| approve \| discard \| review` | Manage submissions queued while feedback mode is `defer`. `review` (experimental) walks the queue interactively (approve/discard/skip per item). See [Feedback → Reviewing deferred submissions](feedback.md#reviewing-deferred-submissions). |
| `npx ue-mcp resolve <issue>` | Fetch a feedback issue, branch, hand it to Claude Code to implement, open a PR. See [Feedback](feedback.md#resolving-feedback-issues). |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin install <name>` | Install a ue-mcp plugin from npm and register it in `ue-mcp.yml`. See [Configuration → Plugins](#plugins). |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin uninstall <name>` | Inverse of install. |
| `npx ue-mcp plugin create <name>` | Scaffold a new plugin package. See [Plugins](plugins.md). |

## Editor Lifecycle

The server can manage the editor process:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `editor(action="start_editor")` | Launch UE with the current project |
| `editor(action="stop_editor")` | Gracefully stop the editor |
| `editor(action="restart_editor")` | Stop and relaunch |
