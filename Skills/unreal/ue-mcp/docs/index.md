# UE-MCP

**Unreal Engine Model Context Protocol Server** - lets AI assistants drive the Unreal Editor through <!-- count:tools -->21<!-- /count --> category tools covering <!-- count:actions -->525+<!-- /count --> actions.

UE-MCP is a bridge between an AI client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.) and the Unreal Editor. It runs a TypeScript MCP server on your machine, which talks over WebSocket to a C++ plugin running inside the editor. The result: your AI can place actors, write blueprints, author materials, sculpt landscape, set up Niagara VFX, configure replication, run PIE, build the project — anything the editor can do.

    Plugin -->|UE API| Editor[Editor Subsystems]
    MCP -->|direct fs| FS[Config INI<br/>C++ Headers<br/>Asset Listing]
```

Filesystem-based reads (config INI parsing, C++ header reflection, asset directory scanning) work even when the editor isn't running, so the AI can explore project structure and source code without a live editor.

## New Here?

Start with **[Getting Started](getting-started.md)**. It assumes zero knowledge — no Node.js, no MCP, no command line — and walks you all the way to your AI placing actors in your level.

## What Can It Do?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Levels** | Place/move/delete actors, spawn lights and volumes, manage splines |
| **Blueprints** | Read/write graphs, add nodes, connect pins, compile, CDO property access |
| **Materials** | Create materials and instances, author expression graphs, set parameters |
| **Assets** | CRUD, import meshes/textures/animations, datatables |
| **Animation** | Read/create anim blueprints, montages, blendspaces, skeletons |
| **VFX** | Create and configure Niagara systems and emitters |
| **Landscape** | Sculpt terrain, paint layers, import heightmaps |
| **PCG** | Author and execute Procedural Content Generation graphs |
| **Foliage** | Painting, types, instance queries |
| **Audio** | SoundCues, MetaSounds, ambient audio |
| **UI** | UMG widget trees, editor utility widgets and blueprints |
| **Gameplay** | Physics, collision, navigation, AI (behavior trees, EQS, perception), input |
| **StateTree** | States, tasks, conditions, transitions, bindings, evaluators, global tasks, parameters |
| **GAS** | Gameplay Ability System - attributes, abilities, effects, cues |
| **Networking** | Replication, dormancy, relevancy, net priority |
| **Editor** | Console commands, Python escape hatch, PIE, viewport, sequencer, build pipeline, logs |
| **Reflection** | Class/struct/enum introspection, gameplay tags |
| **Project** | Status, INI config, C++ source/header parsing, build |
| **Demo** | Built-in 19-step Neon Shrine procedural scene |
| **Feedback** | Submit tool-gap reports as GitHub issues |

Plus a **flow engine** that lets you chain any of these into multi-step YAML workflows with rollback, retries, and step references — see [Flows](flows.md).

And a **plugin system** that lets npm packages inject new actions into the existing categories. Plugins ship through `npm install` and slot into the same `pcg`/`landscape`/etc. tools the agent is already using — there is nothing extra for the agent to discover. See [Plugins](plugins.md) for the author contract and [Configuration → Plugins](configuration.md#plugins) for the consumer view.
