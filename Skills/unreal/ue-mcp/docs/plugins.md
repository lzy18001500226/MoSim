# Plugins

ue-mcp's plugin system lets npm packages extend the server in three ways:

- **Inject** new actions into ue-mcp's built-in categories so agents discover them where they're already working.
- **Provide** entirely new top-level categories that the plugin owns end-to-end.
- **Ship native C++** that registers handlers directly with the editor bridge, opening up engine APIs that have no built-in coverage.

Most plugins use only the first shape; the other two are available when injection is the wrong fit. This page covers both sides: installing and managing plugins (consumer), and writing and publishing one (author). The author section starts at [Authoring a plugin](#authoring-a-plugin) — if you're just trying to use a plugin somebody else wrote, you can stop after [Using plugins](#using-plugins).

!!! info "Live reference"
    [`ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin`](https://github.com/db-lyon/ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin) ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin)) is the canonical reference. It ships one injected `pcg` action over the [Voxel Plugin](https://voxelplugin.com) — `voxel_build_scatter_graph` — with more tracked in its `TODO.md`. The examples below mirror its real source.

## Quick start

In your Unreal project directory:

```bash
ue-mcp plugin install ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin
```

That runs `npm install --save`, validates the plugin's manifest, and adds an entry to your `ue-mcp.yml`. Restart your MCP client (in Claude Code, `/mcp` reconnects); the next time the server boots it will load the plugin, inject its actions into the host categories, and merge its knowledge into the AI-facing docs.

Verify with the introspection tool:

```text
plugins(action="list")
```

```json
{
  "pluginCount": 1,
  "active": 1,
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin",
      "version": "0.2.0",
      "actionPrefix": "voxel",
      "status": "active",
      "categories": ["pcg"],
      "injectedActions": 1,
      "flows": 0,
      "uePluginDependency": "Voxel",
      "uePluginPresent": true
    }
  ]
}
```

Once `status: "active"` and `uePluginPresent: true`, the injected action (e.g. `pcg(action="voxel_build_scatter_graph", ...)`) is callable end-to-end.

## How plugins work

A plugin is a normal npm package that ships:

- A `ue-mcp.plugin.yml` manifest declaring an `actionPrefix`, the actions it injects into which host categories, and the task classes that back them.
- Compiled task classes (one per injected action) under `dist/`, each extending `BaseTask` from [`@db-lyon/flowkit`](https://github.com/db-lyon/flowkit).
- Optional `knowledge/<category>.md` markdown that the server attaches to the host category's AI-facing docs at boot.
- Optional `flows:` entries that compose injected actions with built-ins.

At server start, ue-mcp:

1. Reads `plugins:` from your project's `ue-mcp.yml`.
2. Resolves each entry against `<project>/node_modules/`.
3. Loads and validates each plugin's `ue-mcp.plugin.yml`.
4. Imports its task classes and registers them with the flow runtime.
5. Merges the injected actions into the host category tools — the action shows up as `<category>(action="<prefix>_<bare>", ...)`.
6. Concatenates the plugin's knowledge files into the host categories' AI-facing docs.

The injection happens before any tool is registered with the MCP client, so by the time the agent sees the `pcg` tool's action list, the plugin's actions are already there alongside the built-ins.

### Three shapes a plugin can take

| Shape | Manifest blocks | When to reach for it |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **A. Inject only** | `inject:` | The action belongs inside an existing category. Default choice. |
| **B. Provide a new category** | `provides:` (with or without `inject:`) | The plugin opens a whole new domain - audio middleware, build pipelines, networking layers - that doesn't fit inside any built-in category. |
| **C. Ship native C++** | `nativeModule:` (plus `inject:` or `provides:`) | The plugin needs engine APIs ue-mcp's built-in handlers don't expose. The plugin ships a UE C++ module that registers handlers on the editor bridge. |

Shape A is overwhelmingly the right answer. A standalone "voxel" tool would be opaque to an agent that has no reason to open a category called `voxel` while working on terrain; injecting into `pcg` puts the action at the point of need.

Shape B is for genuinely new domains. If your plugin's actions don't fit anywhere in the built-in category list, owning a new top-level category is cleaner than forcing a misfit injection.

Shape C is for capability that can't be expressed through orchestration of existing actions. The plugin ships C++ source that compiles into the user's project alongside the bridge, and registers handlers via `UEMCP::RegisterExternalHandler` from its `StartupModule`. Native handlers participate in the same dispatch path as built-in ones.

## Using plugins

### Installing

The supported install path is:

```bash
ue-mcp plugin install <package-name>
```

It's a thin wrapper that:

1. Runs `npm install --save <package-name>` so the package lands in `node_modules/` and is recorded in your `package.json`.
2. Validates the plugin's `ue-mcp.plugin.yml` — checks that `actionPrefix` is a legal identifier, every `inject:` target is a real registered category, every `class_path` resolves, and `minServerVersion` is satisfied.
3. Appends a `- name: <package-name>` entry to your `ue-mcp.yml`'s `plugins:` array (creating the array if needed).
4. Prints the restart instruction.

You can also install manually — `npm install --save <package-name>` and edit `ue-mcp.yml` yourself. The end state is identical.

### The `plugins:` array

The consumer surface is a single block in `ue-mcp.yml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin
  - name: ue-mcp-plugin-some-other-thing
    version: "^0.2.0"     # optional; npm semver range against package.json
```

Each entry resolves against the project's `node_modules/`. If `version` is omitted, whatever is currently installed loads. Order matters — see [Ordering and collisions](#ordering-and-collisions).

### Introspection

Two read-only actions on the `plugins` category:

| Action | What it returns |
|--------|-----------------|
| `plugins(action="list")` | Every plugin: name, version, prefix, status, count of injected actions and flows, host UE plugin dependency check. |
| `plugins(action="describe", name="<package>")` | Full detail for one plugin: the same fields as `list`, plus the actual injected action names, knowledge file paths, flows, and the resolved package + manifest paths on disk. |

Both reflect the live state of the server, so they're the right tool when something looks wrong — see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### Host UE plugin dependencies

A plugin can declare a single Unreal-side dependency in its manifest:

```yaml
uePluginDependency: Voxel
```

This is the **`.uplugin` filename** — the same string that appears as `Plugins[].Name` in your `.uproject`. ue-mcp checks for it at server start and reports the result as `uePluginPresent` in `plugins(action="list")`.

The check is informational, not gating: the npm-side plugin loads regardless, and its injected actions appear in the host category tools. But until the UE plugin is enabled in `.uproject` and its C++ modules are built, the actions will fail at execute time with a clear error.

To enable a host UE plugin:

1. Add `{ "Name": "<DepName>", "Enabled": true }` to your `.uproject`'s `Plugins` array.
2. Build the project (e.g. `npm run build` from a Vale-style project, or `editor(action="build_all")`).
3. Restart the editor.
4. Run `plugins(action="list")` to confirm `uePluginPresent: true`.

For source-distributed UE plugins (like Voxel Plugin), drop the source under `Plugins/<DepName>/` — either as a git submodule (recommended for size) or as a vendored copy. The `.uplugin` file inside that directory is what UE's plugin discovery walks.

### Ordering and collisions

- **Plugin vs built-in:** A plugin action can never override a built-in. Collisions are hard-skipped at load time with a warning in the server log; the built-in stays.
- **Plugin vs plugin:** First entry in `plugins:` wins. If two plugins both inject `pcg.foo_bar`, only the earlier-listed one's version is registered. The order is intentionally stable — your `ue-mcp.yml` is the source of truth for resolution.
- **Failed plugins are skipped, not partially loaded.** If a plugin fails validation (bad manifest, missing class_path, server-version mismatch, etc.), it is dropped entirely with a loud warning. Other plugins keep loading. The host tools are never partially mutated.

### Removing a plugin

There is no separate uninstall command — `npm uninstall <package-name>` and delete the entry from `ue-mcp.yml`. On next restart, the actions are gone.

## Available plugins

The reference plugin is `ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin` ([source](https://github.com/db-lyon/ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin)). Search npm for [`ue-mcp-plugin`](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=keywords%3Aue-mcp-plugin) (the convention keyword) to discover others as the ecosystem grows.

## Authoring a plugin

### Quick scaffolder

```bash
ue-mcp plugin create ue-mcp-plugin-my-thing
cd ue-mcp-plugin-my-thing
npm install
npm run build
```

That stamps a working package with `ue-mcp.plugin.yml`, `tsconfig.json`, an example task in `src/tasks/`, and CI scaffolding. From there, replace the example with your own actions and publish.

### Package layout

```
ue-mcp-plugin-<your-name>/
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
  ue-mcp.plugin.yml          # author declaration: actionPrefix, inject, knowledge, tasks, flows
  src/                       # author writes TypeScript here
    tasks/
      MyAction.ts            # one BaseTask subclass per file, default export
    shared/                  # optional cross-task helpers (never referenced from the declaration)
  dist/                      # tsc output - what actually ships and loads
    tasks/
      MyAction.js
  knowledge/
    pcg.md                   # one markdown file per target category
  README.md
```

Conventions:

- One task class per file, default export, extending `BaseTask` from `@db-lyon/flowkit`.
- `class_path` in the declaration is resolved against the plugin's `dist/` (the loader tries `dist/<path>.js` then `dist/tasks/<path>.js`).
- `src/shared/` holds helpers; never reference it from the declaration.
- Compile to `dist/` with `tsc` so users need no TypeScript toolchain.
- The npm package name should start with `ue-mcp-plugin-` so it's discoverable on the registry.

### `package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-plugin",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "description": "Voxel Plugin actions for ue-mcp",
  "type": "module",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "files": ["dist", "ue-mcp.plugin.yml", "knowledge", "README.md"],
  "keywords": ["ue-mcp-plugin", "unreal-engine", "voxel"],
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@db-lyon/flowkit": "~0.5.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@db-lyon/flowkit": "~0.5.2",
    "typescript": "^5.7.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc"
  }
}
```

The `ue-mcp-plugin` keyword is the registry signal. The peer-dep on `@db-lyon/flowkit` is what gives `BaseTask` its shape — your tasks must extend the same class the server uses, so a peer dep (not a regular dep) is what keeps the two copies in sync.

### `ue-mcp.plugin.yml`

This is the only file ue-mcp reads from your package. Authored once; never edited by users.

```yaml
actionPrefix: voxel              # mandatory, lowercase, must match /^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/
minServerVersion: 1.0.15         # optional - the server enforces this at install and load
uePluginDependency: Voxel        # optional - .uplugin filename to check in .uproject

inject:
  pcg:
    build_scatter_graph:         # → pcg(action="voxel_build_scatter_graph")
      task: voxel.build_scatter_graph
      description: "Build a PCG graph that scatters weighted static meshes on a voxel terrain. Wraps UPCGVoxelSamplerSettings + the stock PCGStaticMeshSpawner."
      schema:
        assetPath:             { type: string, required: true }
        meshes:                { type: array,  required: true }
        pointsPerSquaredMeter: { type: number }
        seed:                  { type: number }

tasks:
  voxel.build_scatter_graph:
    class_path: tasks/BuildScatterGraph
    description: "Build a Voxel-Sampler-driven PCG mesh scatter graph"
```

The key under each category is the **bare** action name. The loader prepends your `actionPrefix` to compute the injected name: `voxel` + `build_scatter_graph` → `voxel_build_scatter_graph`. The user always sees the prefixed form.

`knowledge:` and `flows:` are optional — omit them when you have nothing to attach. A plugin can ship a single action and nothing else.

Param schemas under `schema:` accept these types: `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. Non-required params become optional at the top level of the host category tool's schema.

### Providing new categories (`provides:`)

When the plugin's actions don't belong inside any built-in category, declare a `provides:` block. Each entry registers a brand-new top-level MCP category that the plugin owns. Action names are NOT prefixed inside provided categories - the category itself is the namespace.

```yaml
actionPrefix: voxel              # still required (used for any inject: entries)

provides:
  voxel_terrain:                 # → voxel_terrain(action="sample_density", ...)
    description: "Voxel terrain authoring operations"
    actions:
      sample_density:
        task: voxel_terrain.sample_density
        description: "Sample density values along a curve through the voxel world"
        schema:
          start: { type: array, required: true }
          end:   { type: array, required: true }
          steps: { type: number }

tasks:
  voxel_terrain.sample_density:
    class_path: tasks/SampleDensity
```

Rules:

- Provided category names must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/`.
- A provided name may not collide with a built-in category. The CLI fails install with the offending name; the runtime loader skips the plugin with a clear status reason.
- Inter-plugin collisions resolve first-writer-wins. If two installed plugins both `provides: voxel_terrain`, the one earlier in your `plugins:` array claims the name; the other is skipped with a warning visible in `plugins(list)`.
- Knowledge files keyed by a provided category name (`knowledge/voxel_terrain.md`) attach to that category's AI-facing docs the same way they do for injected categories.

A plugin can mix `inject:` and `provides:` freely - whatever fits each action best.

### Shipping native C++ (`nativeModule:`)

When the plugin needs engine APIs ue-mcp's bridge doesn't already expose, ship a UE C++ module alongside the npm package. The module compiles into the user's project at install time and registers handlers on the bridge via `UEMCP::RegisterExternalHandler`.

```yaml
nativeModule:
  uePluginName: VoxelPCGBridge          # name of the .uplugin that gets deployed
  minBridgeApi: 1                       # gate against UEMCP_BRIDGE_API_VERSION
  source: ue/Plugins/VoxelPCGBridge     # path inside your npm tarball
  supportedEngineVersions: ["5.5", "5.6"]
  handlers:
    voxel.sample_density:
      description: "Sample voxel density via the native handler"
```

#### Layout inside the npm tarball

```
ue-mcp-plugin-<name>/
  ue-mcp.plugin.yml
  dist/                              # tsc output (TypeScript tasks)
  ue/                                # NEW: native source ships here
    Plugins/
      VoxelPCGBridge/
        VoxelPCGBridge.uplugin
        Source/
          VoxelPCGBridge/
            VoxelPCGBridge.Build.cs
            Public/
              VoxelPCGBridgeModule.h
            Private/
              VoxelPCGBridgeModule.cpp     # calls UEMCP::RegisterExternalHandler
              SampleDensity.cpp
```

Update `package.json` `files:` so the `ue/` directory ships with the published tarball:

```json
"files": ["dist", "ue", "ue-mcp.plugin.yml", "knowledge", "README.md"]
```

#### The native module

Add `UE_MCP_Bridge` to `PrivateDependencyModuleNames` in your `.Build.cs`:

```csharp
public class VoxelPCGBridge : ModuleRules
{
    public VoxelPCGBridge(ReadOnlyTargetRules Target) : base(Target)
    {
        PublicDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "Core", "CoreUObject", "Engine", "Json" });
        PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "UE_MCP_Bridge" });
    }
}
```

Register handlers from `StartupModule`:

```cpp
#include "VoxelPCGBridgeModule.h"
#include "MCPHandlerRegistration.h"

void FVoxelPCGBridgeModule::StartupModule()
{
    UEMCP::RegisterExternalHandler(
        TEXT("voxel.sample_density"),
        [](const TSharedPtr<FJsonObject>& Params) -> TSharedPtr<FJsonValue>
        {
            // ... do the work, return a JSON value
            TSharedPtr<FJsonObject> Result = MakeShared<FJsonObject>();
            Result->SetBoolField(TEXT("success"), true);
            return MakeShared<FJsonValueObject>(Result);
        });
}

void FVoxelPCGBridgeModule::ShutdownModule()
{
    UEMCP::UnregisterExternalHandler(TEXT("voxel.sample_density"));
}
```

The handler's method name (`voxel.sample_density`) is what the plugin's TypeScript task addresses through `this.call("voxel.sample_density", ...)` or what the bridge looks up when an MCP action dispatches.

#### Install flow

```bash
ue-mcp plugin install ue-mcp-plugin-voxel-pro
```

The CLI now also:

1. Reads `MCPHandlerRegistration.h` from the deployed bridge and checks that `UEMCP_BRIDGE_API_VERSION >= manifest.nativeModule.minBridgeApi`. Install fails fast if the bridge is too old, with a pointer to `ue-mcp update`.
2. Copies `<pkgDir>/<source>` to `<projectDir>/Plugins/<uePluginName>/`.
3. Records every copied file in `<projectDir>/.ue-mcp/native-modules.json` so `ue-mcp plugin uninstall` can clean up without nuking user edits.
4. Prints `REBUILD REQUIRED` - the user must build the UE project before launching the editor so the new module compiles in.

#### Bridge ABI versioning

`UEMCP_BRIDGE_API_VERSION` is the C++ ABI contract every native plugin compiles against. Bumps are reserved for breaking changes to the `FExternalHandlerFn` signature or the registration contract. A plugin declaring `minBridgeApi: N` refuses to load against a bridge whose version is below N. Inspect the deployed bridge's version with:

```text
project(action="get_status")
```

The response includes `bridgeApiVersion` when a bridge is deployed.

### Writing tasks

```ts
// src/tasks/BuildScatterGraph.ts
import { BaseTask, type TaskResult } from "@db-lyon/flowkit";

interface MeshEntry { mesh: string; weight?: number; }

interface Options {
  assetPath: string;
  meshes: MeshEntry[];
  pointsPerSquaredMeter?: number;
  seed?: number;
}

export default class BuildScatterGraph extends BaseTask<Options> {
  get taskName() { return "voxel.build_scatter_graph"; }

  async execute(): Promise<TaskResult> {
    const { assetPath, meshes, pointsPerSquaredMeter = 0.1, seed = 1 } = this.options;
    const slash = assetPath.lastIndexOf("/");
    const packagePath = assetPath.slice(0, slash);
    const name = assetPath.slice(slash + 1);

    // Compose existing MCP actions via this.call('<category>.<action>', ...).
    const created = await this.call("pcg.create_graph", { name, packagePath });
    if (!created.success && !/exist|already/i.test(created.error?.message ?? "")) return created;

    // The bridge's nodeType resolver falls back to /Script/PCG.* only — for
    // VoxelPCG nodes, pass the absolute object path so the first FindObject hits.
    const sampler = await this.call("pcg.add_node", {
      assetPath,
      nodeType: "/Script/VoxelPCG.PCGVoxelSamplerSettings",
    });
    if (!sampler.success) return sampler;

    const spawner = await this.call("pcg.add_node", {
      assetPath,
      nodeType: "/Script/PCG.PCGStaticMeshSpawnerSettings",
    });
    if (!spawner.success) return spawner;

    // ... set_node_settings, connect_nodes, set_static_mesh_spawner_meshes ...
    return { success: true, data: { assetPath, meshCount: meshes.length } };
  }
}
```

Notes:

- Compose existing actions through `this.call('<category>.<action>', params)`. Don't reach into the bridge directly unless you have to — composition gives you free observability and rollback hooks.
- Use the **real** parameter names of the host task you're calling. `pcg.add_node` takes `assetPath` (not `graphPath`) and `nodeType` (which the bridge resolves via `FindObject<UClass>` — bare class names only resolve when the bridge's fallback paths cover the module, so for plugin modules pass the absolute `/Script/<Module>.<UCLASS>` path).
- If your task makes multi-step mutations, return a `rollback` record so users can opt into `rollback_on_failure: true` on the wrapping flow.
- Throw, don't return success-with-error-data. The runtime catches throws and turns them into structured failures.

### Knowledge files

For each category your plugin injects into, ship a short markdown file under `knowledge/`. The server attaches it to that category's AI-facing docs at boot, so the agent sees plugin-specific guidance the moment it looks at that category.

Keep it terse — one screenful per category. Concrete examples beat prose. The agent already knows how the category works; the knowledge file is just the delta the plugin introduces.

```markdown
# Voxel Plugin - PCG actions

`voxel_build_scatter_graph` creates a UPCGGraph asset that wires a
Voxel Sampler into a Static Mesh Spawner. Use it when the user wants
weighted meshes scattered on a voxel terrain rather than the standard
landscape.

Typical sequence:
1. `pcg(action="voxel_build_scatter_graph", assetPath="/Game/PCG/MyScatter", meshes=[{mesh:".../Rock.Rock"}])`
2. Attach the resulting graph to a PCG component near your `AVoxelWorld`.
3. `pcg(action="execute", actorLabel="MyPCGActor")` to materialise the result.
```

### Publishing

```bash
npm run build      # tsc → dist/
npm publish        # public registry
```

Tag your package with the `ue-mcp-plugin` keyword in `package.json` so it shows up in npm searches for the convention. Users install with:

```bash
ue-mcp plugin install ue-mcp-plugin-<your-name>
```

## Validation rules

These are enforced both at install (`ue-mcp plugin install`) and at server load:

- `actionPrefix` is mandatory and must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/`.
- Every `inject:` target must be a real registered category. A nonexistent target fails install with the list of valid categories.
- A plugin action may never overwrite a built-in. Collisions are hard-skipped with a warning.
- Every `provides:` category name must match `/^[a-z][a-z0-9_]*$/` and must not collide with a built-in category.
- Inter-plugin collisions resolve by `plugins:` order - first wins. Applies to both injected actions and provided category names.
- Every `inject:` and `provides:` entry must point to a task declared under `tasks:`, and every task's `class_path` must resolve under `dist/`.
- `minServerVersion` is checked at install and re-checked at load.
- `nativeModule.minBridgeApi` is checked at install (against the deployed bridge's `UEMCP_BRIDGE_API_VERSION`) and re-checked at load.
- A plugin that fails any of these is skipped entirely (never partially injected) with a loud warning. Other plugins keep loading.

## Troubleshooting

### `plugins(action="list")` returns `pluginCount: 0`

The server didn't find any `plugins:` entries, or every entry failed validation. Check:

1. `ue-mcp.yml` exists in your project root next to the `.uproject` and has a top-level `plugins:` array.
2. Each `name:` is installed under `node_modules/`. Run `npm install` if the lockfile says it should be there.
3. The server's stderr log — every validation failure prints a `[ue-mcp] warn plugin: <package>: <reason>` line at boot.

### `uePluginPresent: false`

The npm-side plugin loaded fine, but the host Unreal plugin it declares as a dependency is missing from your `.uproject`. See [Host UE plugin dependencies](#host-ue-plugin-dependencies) for the enable steps. The injected actions are still visible in the host category tools — they just won't run end-to-end until the UE plugin is enabled and built.

### `class_path '<path>' could not be resolved`

The plugin's `ue-mcp.plugin.yml` declared a task whose compiled JS file is missing from `dist/`. If you're authoring: run `npm run build` and confirm `dist/<path>.js` exists. If you're consuming: the package was published without its `dist/` directory — open an issue on the plugin's repo.

### `requires server >= <version>`

The plugin's `minServerVersion` is newer than the ue-mcp you're running. Update:

```bash
npm install ue-mcp@latest
```

Then restart your MCP client.

### Injected action appears in `plugins.describe` but not in the host category tool's action list

You restarted the editor but not the MCP server. They're separate processes — the editor restart doesn't respawn the npx-launched ue-mcp server. Reconnect MCP in your client (in Claude Code, `/mcp`).

### `nativeModule requires bridge ABI >= N`

The plugin needs a newer bridge than the one deployed in this project. Run `ue-mcp update` to refresh the bridge source, then `npm run build` (or rebuild from the editor) before retrying. The deployed ABI is also visible in `project(action="get_status")` as `bridgeApiVersion`.

### Provided category does not show up as its own MCP tool

The plugin loaded but a name collision skipped its `provides:` entry. Run `plugins(action="describe", name="<package>")` and check the `provided` field. If it's empty, look at the server boot log for a `provides target '<category>' already claimed by '<other plugin>'` warning - earlier-listed plugins win, so reorder your `plugins:` array or drop one of the conflicting packages.

### Native module deployed but handlers come back `Unknown method`

The C++ side didn't compile in. Two common causes:

1. The user never rebuilt after install. Run `npm run build` from the project (or rebuild from the editor IDE) and confirm the new `.dll` lands under `Binaries/Win64/`.
2. The build failed silently because the deployed bridge is older than the plugin expects. Run `ue-mcp update` to refresh `MCPHandlerRegistration.h`, then `npm run build`.

If the rebuild succeeds but `Unknown method` persists, you've hit a stale Live Coding patch: delete `<projectDir>/Binaries/Win64/*.patch_*` and rebuild clean. UBT's incremental build can otherwise shadow a freshly built DLL with a leftover patch.
