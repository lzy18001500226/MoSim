export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `UE-MCP: Unreal Engine editor bridge (C++ plugin) — 19 category tools covering 425+ actions.

Every tool takes an "action" parameter that selects the operation. Call project(action="get_status") first.

═══ QUICK START ═══
1. project(action="get_status") — check if the editor is connected
2. If not connected: editor(action="start_editor") to launch UE
3. level(action="get_outliner") — see what's in the current level
4. asset(action="list") — browse project assets
5. reflection(action="reflect_class", className="StaticMeshActor") — understand any UE class
6. demo(action="step", stepIndex=1) through 19 — run the Neon Shrine demo to see the bridge in action
7. demo(action="cleanup") — clean up after the demo

═══ TIPS ═══
• Start with level(action="get_outliner") or asset(action="list") to discover what's in the project.
• Use reflection(action="reflect_class") to understand any UE class's properties.
• asset(action="search", query="/Game/Characters/*") accepts wildcards.
• For BP scripting: blueprint(action="search_node_types") → blueprint(action="add_node") → blueprint(action="connect_pins").
• editor(action="execute_python") is the escape hatch for any Unreal Python API call.
• Animation tools need a skeleton path — use animation(action="list_skeletal_meshes") to find it.
• Editor lifecycle: editor(action="stop_editor") / editor(action="start_editor") / editor(action="restart_editor") manage the UE process.
• editor(action="hot_reload") triggers Live Coding compilation without restarting the editor.
• editor(action="focus_on_actor", actorLabel="MyActor") snaps the viewport to any actor.
• Log output: editor(action="get_log", category="LogMCPBridge") to see bridge-specific logs.

═══ FLOWS — READ BEFORE ACTING ═══

Before you run bash/npm commands or chain 3+ category tool calls to
satisfy a user request, look at the \`flows\` field returned by
project(action="get_status").

That field lists named, pre-built sequences for this project. Each
entry has a name and description. If ANY flow's description matches
what the user asked for, you MUST run it instead of building the
sequence yourself.

Examples:
  User asks                          | Look for a flow like
  ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------
  "rebuild and relaunch the editor"  | rebuild
  "run the smoke tests"              | smoke
  "redeploy the plugin"              | deploy, redeploy
  "package the project"              | package

Run a matched flow with: flow(action="run", flowName="<name>")

DO NOT:
- Skip the get_status flows check before running bash/npm yourself.
- Author a new flow on your own. Only the user authors flows.
- Suggest a flow for a one-off task the user is unlikely to repeat.

DO suggest a new flow IF AND ONLY IF all three are true:
  1. You just finished a sequence with 3+ steps.
  2. The sequence had the same shape every run, with only 1-2 values
     changing.
  3. The user is likely to ask for the same shape again.
In that case say: "This sequence (X -> Y -> Z) might be worth registering
as a flow in ue-mcp.yml. Want me to draft one?" Then STOP. Wait.

═══ FEEDBACK ═══
If you had to use editor(action="execute_python") as a workaround because a native tool
couldn't handle the task, keep a mental note of what you did and why. When your task is
complete, tell the user:
  "I had to use custom Python scripts to [describe what]. Would you like to submit
   feedback to help improve ue-mcp?"
If the user agrees, call feedback(action="submit") with:
  • title — short, generic description of the gap (no project-specific details)
  • summary — what was attempted and why the native tool fell short
  • pythonWorkaround — the Python code that was used
  • idealTool — what tool/action should handle this natively
This creates a GitHub issue so the maintainers can add proper support.
