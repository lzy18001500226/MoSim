## 1. Sub-library Priority

Use the following discovery order unless the scenario strongly suggests otherwise:

1. `NPSLibrary.Sources`
2. `NPSLibrary.PowerSystem`
3. `NPSLibrary.PowerElectronics`
4. `NPSLibrary.Motors`
5. `NPSLibrary.Sensors`
6. `NPSLibrary.Utilities`

Rules:

- Prefer same-name components first.
- If there is no same-name component, map by physical function.
- If the user explicitly names a topology or key component, continue searching inside `NPSLibrary` for other families, class paths, or conversion blocks before changing the requested structure.
- Do not pull in components from other power-system libraries unless the user explicitly requests or approves that library exception.
- Do not mix a high-level converter block with its internal detailed semiconductor reconstruction unless the task explicitly requires secondary development.
- Keep the minimum closed loop small before adding observers, protection, and controller refinements.

## 2. Common Mapping Rules

| Intent | Preferred sub-library or blocks | Mandatory supporting blocks | Typical observables |
|--------|---------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| Three-phase source network | `Sources`, `PowerSystem`, transformer, line, load | `Ground` or reference, `Powergui`, measurement blocks | Node voltage, line current, P/Q, transformer variables |
| Grid-tied inverter | Converter bridge, filter, grid boundary, `PLL`, PWM, dq controller | `Powergui`, voltage/current measurement, P/Q measurement | Grid current, PCC voltage, DC bus voltage, modulation, PLL angle |
| Boost or Buck converter | Power-electronics switch stage, diode, inductor, capacitor, load | `Ground`, PWM, sensors | Output voltage, inductor current, duty ratio |
| Bidirectional DCDC | Bidirectional switch bridge, inductive branch, storage side, control | `Ground`, current and voltage sensors, PWM | Bus voltage, transfer current, charge/discharge direction |
| Motor drive | Inverter, motor, transforms, PI, speed loop | `Powergui`, current/speed/angle sensors | Speed, torque, dq current, controller output |
| Load-flow network | Source, transformer, line, load, `LoadFlowBus` | `Powergui`, P/Q constraint blocks | Voltage magnitude, phase angle, branch P/Q |

Load-flow reminder:

- Ask first whether load-flow initialization is desired; when it is, define bus roles explicitly and include `LoadFlowBus` plus `Powergui` load-flow initialization.
- Even outside dedicated load-flow studies, load-flow initialization can be a valid default aid for reaching steady state faster when the scenario fits.

## 3. Diagram and Connection Rules

These are hard reviewability rules, not optional styling suggestions.

- Every placed component should carry `annotation(Placement(...))`.
- Every connection that must be reviewable on the diagram should have visible `annotation(Line(points=...))` in addition to the real `connect(...)`.
- When a `connect(...)` is added or changed in text, repair the corresponding diagram `Line(points=...)` in the same edit round.
- A prior diagram review becomes stale as soon as later wiring edits change the connection set; rerun the review against the latest model state.
- For graphical wiring tasks, prefer GUI-side `ConnectPort`; do not use deprecated `AddConnection`.
- Do not treat direct text wiring as equivalent to GUI wiring when the requested deliverable is a GUI-reviewable diagram.
- For electrical-interface wiring, prefer explicit `color={0,0,255}` as the default visible convention unless the library already documents another standard.
- Keep `Diagram(coordinateSystem(...))` on the model so the layout remains exportable and stable.
- Route main power lines first, then sensing lines, then control lines.
- Avoid crossing power-path lines through dense control areas when a cleaner orthogonal route is available.
- Keep source -> conversion or network -> load as the dominant left-to-right or top-to-bottom visual chain.
- After major edits, export the diagram or use `smart_layout` plus diagram export once before claiming completion.
- Before `check`, confirm from the latest model text or latest exported diagram that the critical `connect(...)` set still maps to reviewable `annotation(Line(...))`.
- If an electrical line is rendered black, verify whether the black color comes from missing explicit color, overwritten annotation, or a valid library convention before accepting the diagram.
- If the model checks successfully but the diagram is unreadable, Step 5 and final acceptance are not complete.

## 4. Grounding and Electrical Reference Rules

- Add the correct electrical reference for each isolated electrical island.
- For transformer-isolated primary and secondary sides, verify whether both sides need their own reference ground.
- If a subsystem already contains an internal reference or grounding mechanism, do not add a duplicate external ground blindly.
- When results look unstable, first re-check missing reference points before tuning controllers.
- For three-phase source or network cases, ensure phase sequence, polarity, and winding connection mode are consistent before simulation.
- During error diagnosis, check `Ground / Reference` as the first required item before deeper parameter or topology changes.
- Treat missing, duplicated, or wrongly sided grounding as a first-class root cause for `check`, `translate`, initialization, and abnormal-result failures.

## 5. Simulation Setup Baseline

Use the following default baseline unless the case has a stronger documented requirement:

- Prefer discrete simulation for switching, PWM, digital control, and PLL-dominant models.
- Prefer inline implicit Euler as the starting discrete solver for power-electronics switching cases.
- Record switching period, sampling period, control period, and simulation step size together.
- Use `step <= T/10` as the practical default rule when `T` is the fastest relevant period and no stronger rule is available.
- Sampling period should equal the control period or stay in a stable integer-multiple relationship unless there is a clear reason otherwise.
- In load-flow scenarios, make the `Powergui` or `LoadFlowBus` initialization mode explicit.
- Do not present simulation results without recording the solver and step-size choice.

## 6. Interface Conversion Rules

- Do not directly force-connect mismatched single-phase and three-phase connectors.
- When converting among electrical connector forms, prefer official conversion blocks such as `PlugToPin_p` and `PlugToPins_p` when applicable.
- If the scenario uses vectorized or multi-phase interfaces, make the dimension and phase meaning explicit in the parameter record.
- When a port-domain mismatch appears during check or translate, solve the interface model first instead of patching downstream equations.
- Treat one-dimensional versus three-dimensional interfaces, scalar versus vector ports, and phase-count mismatch as hard compatibility checks, not optional cleanup.
- For interface mismatch, repair connection topology or add the right conversion block first; do not delete the connected component just to force translation to pass.

## 7. Parameter Completion Baseline

- Prefer user-provided values over all defaults.
- For three-phase systems, always state whether voltages are line voltages or phase voltages.
- For inverters and converters, explicitly record DC-side voltage, switching frequency, filter parameters, and key controller parameters.
- For transformers and lines, explicitly record connection mode, turns ratio or impedance model, and main network parameters.
- For motors, explicitly record rated power, rated voltage, pole pairs, inertia, load torque, and operating condition when available.
- For batteries or storage blocks, explicitly record rated voltage, capacity, initial SOC, and charge/discharge direction convention.
- If a parameter is assumed, state both its value and its source category: default, case-based, inferred, or user-specified.

## 8. Result Review and Acceptance Cues

- Grid-tied systems: focus on voltage-current phase alignment, dynamic response, steady-state error, ripple, and oscillation.
- DCDC systems: focus on direction, steady-state value, overshoot, ripple, and current sign.
- Motor drives: focus on speed tracking, torque response, current waveform quality, and controller stability.
- Three-phase supply networks: focus on voltage level, power transfer, line drop, transformer behavior, and load response.
- Load-flow analysis: focus on voltage magnitude, phase angle, and P/Q distribution consistency.
- A result cannot be accepted if key variables are missing, diagram review is missing, or the delivery package omits solver and step-size evidence.
- Final acceptance grading should follow `references/acceptance-checklist.md`.
