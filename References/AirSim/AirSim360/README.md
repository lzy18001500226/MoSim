## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Download and install AirSim360 software

- **AirSim360 Air** — [Download on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Insta360-Research/AirSim360/tree/main/AirSim360_Air_Beta). Designed for direct use with zero environment setup: download the package, unzip it on Windows, start the remote-control program first, and then launch the main simulator.
- **AirSim360 Pro** — [Download on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Insta360-Research/AirSim360/tree/main/AirSim360_Pro_Beta). Shipped as a compiled package for professional developer control: download it, unzip it, run the simulator, and connect via Python or RPC to access the custom API for programmatic control.
- Detailed usage guides are available in [`software/AirSim360_Air_User_Guide_EN.md`](software/AirSim360_Air_User_Guide_EN.md) and [`software/AirSim360_Pro_User_Guide_EN.md`](software/AirSim360_Pro_User_Guide_EN.md).

### 2. Start with the currently released datasets

- Current public dataset tracks include **Omni360-Scene** and **Omni360-WayPoint**.
- **Omni360-Scene** — [Download on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Insta360-Research/AirSim360/tree/main/Omni360-Scene)
- **Omni360-WayPoint** — [Download on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Insta360-Research/AirSim360/tree/main/Omni360-WayPoint)
- Note: **Omni360-Scene** is now publicly available, and additional open-source data will be released later this week.
- **Omni360-Scene** follows the same structure shown in the [demo sample](data/demo_sample/): every frame is aligned across modalities by a shared file stem.
- The core released modalities are:
  - **Raw (panorama):** Equirectangular RGB images.
  - **Depth:** True Euclidean depth in meters, stored as HDF5 datasets.
  - **Semantic (seg_panorama):** Semantic labels with class IDs carried in the Alpha channel.
  - **Instance (instance_panorama):** Instance labels where `(Alpha, R, G, B)` uniquely identifies an object, with Alpha storing the semantic class ID.
- See [`data/demo_sample/PANORAMIC_DATA_FORMAT.md`](data/demo_sample/PANORAMIC_DATA_FORMAT.md) for the full format specification, and [`data/demo_sample/depth/read_depth_h5.py`](data/demo_sample/depth/read_depth_h5.py) for a minimal depth reader.
- A dedicated **Omni360-WayPoint** section with dataset breakdown and demo scripts will be added in a future update.

## 🌍 Omni360-Scene

**Omni360-Scene** is the current panoramic scene-understanding release in the Omni360-X collection. The sample under [data/demo_sample](data/demo_sample/) shows the core organization used by this dataset: the same frame stem is shared across RGB, depth, semantic, and instance labels, which makes multimodal alignment straightforward.

The current public specification focuses on four aligned outputs:

- **Raw (panorama):** Equirectangular RGB images.
- **Depth:** True Euclidean depth in meters, saved as an HDF5 `/depth` dataset with `float32` values **directly in meters** — no rescaling or de-quantization is needed when reading. Maximum supported distance is 1000 m. For backward compatibility, the reader (`data/demo_sample/depth/read_depth_h5.py`) also accepts the legacy `uint16` format with a `depth_range_m` attribute, recovered via `depth_uint16 / 65535 * depth_range_m`.
- **Semantic (seg_panorama):** Semantic labels aligned pixel-by-pixel with the panorama, where the Alpha channel stores the semantic class ID. The mapping of class names to IDs is recorded in the `semantic_list` text file.
- **Instance (instance_panorama):** Instance labels where the **(Alpha, R, G, B)** tuple identifies a specific object instance, with Alpha storing the semantic class ID.

</p>

The current public release covers three main scenes with full support for all four modalities (RGB, depth, semantic, and instance). The corresponding semantic label IDs are shipped alongside each dataset.

| Scene | RGB | Depth | Semantic | Instance | Open-Source Count |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| City Park Environment Collection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 80,000 |
| Downtown West Modular Pack | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 24,812 |
| New York City | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | 20,716 |
| **Current public total** | — | — | — | — | **125,528** |

> **Notes:**
> 1. Additional premium/paid scenes will be released and updated on a monthly basis.
> 2. Appropriate randomization has been applied to all 6 degrees of freedom (6-DoF) for the panoramic camera across the provided datasets. This ensures a diverse variety of viewing positions and directions, rather than fixing a single orientation.

## 🛣️ Long-Term Open-Source Plan

- Starting May 2026, we will release 5 new AirSim360 scenes each month, shared across the Air and Pro editions.
- Starting May 2026, we will also release 2 new dataset scenes each month, each containing 2,000 panoramic images. Data types will be adjusted based on developer feedback, and community suggestions are welcome.
- Before the end of Q2 2026, we will provide additional dynamic human assets inside the AirSim360 software packages, along with the corresponding calling methods and automatic ground attachment for human placement — so developers no longer need to know ground coordinates in advance.
- We welcome feedback on software usage. Adopted suggestions will be acknowledged in a new section at the end of this page.
- The panoramic plugin and other useful features will be published separately on FAB, and will be free for individual developers.
