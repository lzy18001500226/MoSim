## **Fast-Exploration** 

This document is an extension of [FUEL](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL), which is closer to the real experiment through Gazebo simulation. 

## The main updates are: 

1. Added the one-key takeoff function of the [controller](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Fast-Drone-250/tree/master/src/realflight_modules/px4ctrl)
2. Optimized the visual interface

## Achieve results：

## How to use: 
1. Follow this [link](https://www.yuque.com/xtdrone/manual_cn/install_scripts) to install the simulation platform. For details, please refer to this [project](https://github.com/robin-shaun/XTDrone)

2. Start Simulation：

   `roslaunch px4 indoor1.launch`

3. Follow this [link](https://www.yuque.com/xtdrone/manual_cn/pose_groundtruth) to set the location

4. Start planer

   `roslaunch exploration_manager rviz.launch`

   `roslaunch exploration_manager exploration.launch`

5. Start Controller

   `roslaunch px4ctrl singl_run.launch`

6. Start Monitor

   `roslaunch ftxui_ros single_start.launch`


## Try Real Fly (todo)

 1. Change ROS Topic Name in Launch File.

 2. Add [VINS](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Fusion) for location.

 3. Change [Parm](https://github.com/XXLiu-HNU/Fast-Exploration/blob/main/src/realflight_modules/px4ctrl/config/ctrl_param_fpv.yaml) in px4ctrl for your Quadrotor

 4. Something Else Possible ...

## Reference Projects
1. [XTDroen](https://github.com/robin-shaun/XTDrone)   
The simulation platform of the experiment is modified based on this project. Interested readers can refer to the [document](https://www.yuque.com/xtdrone/manual_cn/install_scripts) for reproduction
2. [Fast-Drone-250](https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/Fast-Drone-250)   
The controller module comes from this project, but this project is only for real objects and a single drone.
3. [FUEL](https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/FUEL)   
The  planning part comes from this project.
