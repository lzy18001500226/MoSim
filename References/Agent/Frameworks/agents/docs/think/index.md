# Think (Experimental)

`@cloudflare/think` is an opinionated chat agent base class for Cloudflare Workers. It handles the full chat lifecycle — agentic loop, message persistence, streaming, tool execution, client tools, stream resumption, and extensions — all backed by Durable Object SQLite.

Think works as both a **top-level agent** (WebSocket chat to browser clients via `useAgentChat`) and a **sub-agent** (RPC streaming from a parent agent via `chat()`).

> **Experimental.** The API surface is stable but may evolve before graduating out of experimental.

## Quick Start

### Install

```sh
npm install @cloudflare/think agents ai @cloudflare/shell zod workers-ai-provider
```

### Server

```typescript
import { Think } from "@cloudflare/think";
import { createWorkersAI } from "workers-ai-provider";
import { routeAgentRequest } from "agents";

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getModel() {
    return createWorkersAI({ binding: this.env.AI })(
      "@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6"
    );
  }
}

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env) {
    return (
      (await routeAgentRequest(request, env)) ||
      new Response("Not found", { status: 404 })
    );
  }
} satisfies ExportedHandler<Env>;
```

That is it. Think handles the WebSocket chat protocol, message persistence, the agentic loop, message sanitization, stream resumption, client tool support, and workspace file tools. The built-in `read` tool reads text with line numbers and passes images/PDFs through to multimodal-capable models.

## Messengers

Think agents can receive and reply to messenger webhooks directly. Messenger
helpers are exported from `@cloudflare/think/messengers`, while provider
implementations use provider subpaths so unused Chat SDK adapters are not
bundled.

For Telegram messengers, also install the Telegram adapter:

```bash
npm install @chat-adapter/telegram
```

```typescript
import { Think } from "@cloudflare/think";
import {
  defineMessengers,
  ThinkMessengerStateAgent
} from "@cloudflare/think/messengers";
import telegramMessenger from "@cloudflare/think/messengers/telegram";

export { ThinkMessengerStateAgent };

export class SupportAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getMessengers() {
    return defineMessengers({
      telegram: telegramMessenger({
        token: this.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN,
        userName: "support_bot",
        secretToken: this.env.TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN
      })
    });
  }
}
```

The root Think agent handles messenger webhook routes before user-defined
`onRequest` fallback. By default, the `telegram` key maps to
`/messengers/telegram/webhook`. Direct messages and mentions route to the model
by default. New mentions subscribe the thread so later mentions are still
observed; ordinary subscribed-thread messages and button actions are opt-in with
`respondTo: ["subscribed-thread", "action"]`. Each Chat SDK thread gets its own
Think sub-agent for memory isolation. A root agent owns one Chat SDK runtime for
all configured messengers, so multiple providers share state and webhook
handling without competing over Chat SDK singleton registration.

Use `conversation: "self"` to run messenger turns on the root Think agent:

```typescript
telegramMessenger({
  token: this.env.TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN,
  userName: "support_bot",
  secretToken: this.env.TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET_TOKEN,
  conversation: "self"
});
```

Messenger state is backed by `agents/chat-sdk`. Export
`ThinkMessengerStateAgent` from the Worker module so sub-agent routing can
resolve it. Production applications do not need a separate Durable Object
binding or migration for the state agent when it is mounted as a sub-agent
facet.

Inbound messenger replies use `chat()` with a streaming callback inside an
idempotent root-agent fiber. Use `submitMessages()` for non-streaming
programmatic sends, scheduled digests, or background work. Normalized messenger
events include thread, author, message, capabilities, actions, and attachment
metadata. Attachment bytes are fetched only when the provider supplies a safe
fetch function.

Messenger reply recovery stores serializable event and thread snapshots. If a
Durable Object restarts before streaming starts, Think can resume the answer; if
it restarts after streaming has begun, the delivery policy posts the configured
interruption message. `getMessengerContext()` returns the initiating messenger
context during the turn. Telegram webhook verification must be explicit: set
`secretToken`, provide `verifyWebhook`, or use `verifyWebhook: false` to opt out
intentionally. Custom `chatSdkMessenger()` definitions must also choose a
verification posture explicitly. Delivery failures use a generic user-facing
error by default so internal exception details are not posted into external
chats.

### Client

```tsx
import { useAgent } from "agents/react";
import { useAgentChat } from "@cloudflare/ai-chat/react";

function Chat() {
  const agent = useAgent({ agent: "MyAgent" });
  const { messages, sendMessage, status } = useAgentChat({ agent });

  return (
    <div>
      {messages.map((msg) => (
        <div key={msg.id}>
          <strong>{msg.role}:</strong>
          {msg.parts.map((part, i) =>
            part.type === "text" ? <span key={i}>{part.text}</span> : null
          )}
        </div>
      ))}

      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          const input = e.currentTarget.elements.namedItem(
            "input"
          ) as HTMLInputElement;
          sendMessage({ text: input.value });
          input.value = "";
        }}
      >
        <input name="input" placeholder="Send a message..." />
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Think vs AIChatAgent

Both Think and [`AIChatAgent`](../chat-agents.md) extend `Agent` and speak the same `cf_agent_chat_*` WebSocket protocol. They serve different goals.

**AIChatAgent** is a protocol adapter. You override `onChatMessage` and are responsible for calling `streamText`, wiring tools, converting messages, and returning a `Response`. AIChatAgent handles the plumbing — message persistence, streaming, abort, resume — but the LLM call is entirely your concern.

**Think** is an opinionated framework. It makes decisions for you: `getModel()` returns the model, `getSystemPrompt()` or `configureSession()` sets the prompt, `getTools()` returns tools. The default `onChatMessage` runs the complete agentic loop. You override individual pieces, not the whole pipeline.

| Concern                | AIChatAgent                                                      | Think                                                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Minimal subclass**   | ~15 lines (wire `streamText` + tools + system prompt + response) | 3 lines (`getModel()` only)                                         |
| **Storage**            | Flat SQL table                                                   | Session: tree-structured messages, context blocks, compaction, FTS5 |
| **Regeneration**       | Destructive (old response deleted)                               | Non-destructive branching (old responses preserved)                 |
| **Context management** | Manual                                                           | Context blocks with LLM-writable persistent memory                  |
| **Sub-agent RPC**      | Not built in                                                     | `chat()` with `StreamCallback`                                      |
| **Programmatic turns** | `saveMessages()`                                                 | `saveMessages()`, `submitMessages()`, `continueLastTurn()`          |
| **Compaction**         | `maxPersistedMessages` (deletes oldest)                          | Non-destructive summaries via overlays                              |
| **Search**             | Not available                                                    | FTS5 full-text search per-session and cross-session                 |

### When to use AIChatAgent

- You need full control over the LLM call (RAG, multi-model, custom streaming)
- You are migrating from AI SDK v4 (`autoTransformMessages` provides the bridge)
- You want the `Response` return type for HTTP middleware or testing
- You are building a simple chatbot with no memory requirements

### When to use Think

- You want to ship fast (3-line subclass with everything wired)
- You need persistent memory (context blocks the model can read and write)
- You need long conversations (non-destructive compaction)
- You need conversation search (FTS5)
- You are building a sub-agent system (parent-child RPC with streaming)
- You need proactive agents (programmatic turns from scheduled tasks or webhooks)
- You need durable async submission for webhook/RPC callers — see [Programmatic submissions](./programmatic-submissions.md)

## Choosing a Turn API

Think has several ways to start or continue a turn. Choose based on who is
driving the work and what the caller needs back.

| Use case                                                       | API                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A browser user sends chat messages                             | `useAgentChat` over the WebSocket chat protocol |
| Server code can wait for the model response                    | `saveMessages()`                                |
| Server code needs fast durable acceptance and later status     | `submitMessages()`                              |
| Code should create recurring prompt-driven turns or handlers   | `getScheduledTasks()`                           |
| Parent code needs direct streaming RPC to a specific child     | `subAgent(...).chat()`                          |
| A parent agent delegates work to a retained child agent        | `agentTool()` or `runAgentTool()`               |
| Surround a turn with idempotent app-owned side effects         | `startFiber()`                                  |
| Coordinate multi-step durable orchestration                    | Workflows                                       |
| Add context or messages without starting a model turn          | `persistMessages()`                             |
| Advanced subclass or recovery code continues an assistant turn | `continueLastTurn()`                            |

Use [`saveMessages()`](./sub-agents.md#programmatic-turns-with-savemessages)
when the caller owns the trigger and can wait for the turn to finish. Use
[`submitMessages()`](./programmatic-submissions.md) when timeout ambiguity would
make retries unsafe.

Use [`chat()`](./sub-agents.md#sub-agent-via-chat) for low-level parent-to-child
streaming when your code owns forwarding, cancellation, and replay policy. Use
[Agent Tools](../agent-tools.md) when a parent model or workflow delegates to a
child agent and you want retained child runs, event replay, abort bridging, and
UI drill-in.

Use [`startFiber()`](../durable-execution.md#startfiber) outside Think when the
durable unit is an application job around a turn: accepting a webhook once,
restoring a serialized channel/thread target, posting a visible reply, or
recording app-level recovery policy. Think submissions own conversation
admission and turn serialization; managed fibers own external job acceptance,
idempotent side effects, and application recovery. Think and AIChat internals
continue to use raw `runFiber()` for stream recovery because those fibers are
internal recovery records, not externally inspectable application jobs.

Use [Workflows](../workflows.md) when the durable unit is a multi-step process
with retries per step, long waits, external events, or approvals.

## Agent Skills

Think supports [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) as on-demand
instructions. A skill source provides a catalog of skill names and descriptions;
Think adds that catalog to the system prompt and exposes tools the model can use
when a user task matches a skill.

Bundled skills are usually imported with the Agents Vite plugin:

```typescript
import { Think, skills } from "@cloudflare/think";
import bundledSkills from "agents:skills"; // resolves to ./skills next to this file

type Env = {
  AI: Ai;
  LOADER: WorkerLoader;
  SKILLS_BUCKET: R2Bucket;
};

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getSkills() {
    return [
      bundledSkills,
      skills.r2(this.env.SKILLS_BUCKET, { prefix: "skills/" })
    ];
  }

  getSkillScriptRunner() {
    return skills.runner({
      loader: this.env.LOADER,
      workspaceInstance: this.workspace
    });
  }
}
```

`agents:skills` resolves to a `./skills` directory next to the importing file;
use `agents:skills/<dir>` to point at a differently named sibling directory.
The `agents:skills` import is typed by ambient declarations that ship with
`agents`, so importing `Think` in the same file brings the type into scope (for
a file that imports only the specifier, add
`/// <reference types="agents/skills-module" />`). If you are not using the
Agents Vite plugin, build a source with `skills.fromManifest(...)` instead.

The skills engine lives in `agents/skills` and is framework-agnostic, so any
agent (including a plain `@cloudflare/ai-chat` `onChatMessage`) can build a
`SkillRegistry`; `@cloudflare/think` re-exports it as `skills` and wires
`getSkills()` into the turn automatically.

Sources are applied in order; the first source to register a skill name wins,
and later duplicates (or a source that fails to load) are skipped with a logged
warning rather than failing the agent.

The imported directory should contain one child directory per skill:

```text
src/skills/release-notes/SKILL.md
src/skills/release-notes/scripts/format-release-notes.ts
src/skills/release-notes/references/style-guide.md
```

When skills are available, Think exposes:

| Tool                  | Purpose                                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `activate_skill`      | Load a matching skill's instructions and bundled resource list      |
| `read_skill_resource` | Read a bundled resource by `{ name, path }` or `skill-name/path`    |
| `run_skill_script`    | Run a bundled script when `getSkillScriptRunner()` returns a runner |

Skills are not always-on system prompt text. Use `getSystemPrompt()` or a
Session context block for behavior that should apply to every turn. Use skills
for task-specific procedures, references, scripts, templates, and assets that
should be loaded only when relevant.

Script execution is opt-in and requires a Worker Loader binding:

```jsonc
{
  "worker_loaders": [{ "binding": "LOADER" }]
}
```

`skills.runner()` is experimental and runs JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and
Bash scripts under `scripts/`. TypeScript is compiled with
`@cloudflare/worker-bundler`; Python runs as Python Dynamic Workers; Bash runs
through `just-bash`.

JavaScript and TypeScript scripts are function-style:

```typescript
import type { SkillRunContext } from "@cloudflare/think";

export default async function run(input: unknown, ctx: SkillRunContext) {
  const guide = ctx.files["references/style-guide.md"]; // bundled text resources
  const docs = await ctx.workspace.readFile("README.md"); // gated by permission
  const summary = await ctx.tools.call("summarize", { input }); // explicit tools
  await ctx.output.writeFile("notes.md", summary); // scratch artifact
  return { ok: true };
}
```

`ctx` is `{ skill, files, workspace, tools, output }`. `ctx.files` holds bundled
text resources by relative path, `ctx.workspace` is gated by the workspace
permission, `ctx.tools` only exposes tools the runner was given, and
`ctx.output.writeFile(name, content)` returns scratch artifacts to the model
(it does not mutate the workspace). Python and Bash use the path-based contract
instead: `/input.json`, `/context.json`, bundled resources under `/skill`, and
`/output` for artifacts.

Passing `workspaceInstance` gives scripts read-only workspace access by default.
Network access, tools, and workspace writes are opt-in. The default timeout is
30 seconds.

### Chat Recovery

Think wraps chat turns in recoverable fibers by default. If the Durable Object is evicted mid-stream, Think reconstructs any buffered chunks, persists partial output, and schedules either a continuation of the assistant turn or a retry of the unanswered user turn.

Override `onChatRecovery` when you need provider-specific recovery, such as retrieving a stored OpenAI Responses result instead of issuing a new model call:

```typescript
import type {
  ChatRecoveryContext,
  ChatRecoveryOptions
} from "@cloudflare/think";

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  override chatRecovery = {
    maxAttempts: 6,
    terminalMessage: "The assistant was interrupted. Please try again."
  };

  override async onChatRecovery(
    ctx: ChatRecoveryContext
  ): Promise<ChatRecoveryOptions> {
    console.log("Recovering chat turn", ctx.incidentId, ctx.attempt);
    return {}; // persist partial output and continue/retry when possible
  }
}
```

The same recovery events are available through `agents/observability` on the `chat` channel. Transcript repairs are emitted on the `transcript` channel.

## Dynamic Configuration

`configure()` and `getConfig()` persist a JSON-serializable config blob in SQLite. It survives hibernation and restarts. Pass the config shape as a method-level generic for typed call sites:

```typescript
type MyConfig = { modelTier: "fast" | "capable"; theme: string };

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getModel() {
    const tier = this.getConfig<MyConfig>()?.modelTier ?? "fast";
    const models = {
      fast: "@cf/moonshotai/kimi-k2.6",
      capable: "@cf/meta/llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct"
    };
    return createWorkersAI({ binding: this.env.AI })(models[tier]);
  }
}
```

| Method                 | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `configure<T>(config)` | Persist a config object (type checked via the method generic) |
| `getConfig<T>()`       | Read the persisted configuration, or null if never configured |

Prefer `state` / `setState` from `Agent` when you want the value broadcast to connected clients. Use `configure` for private, server-side settings.

Expose configuration to the client via `@callable`:

```typescript
import { callable } from "agents";

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getModel() {
    /* ... */
  }

  @callable()
  updateConfig(config: MyConfig) {
    this.configure<MyConfig>(config);
  }
}
```

## Scheduled Tasks

Use `getScheduledTasks()` when code should create recurring Think turns or
deterministic scheduled handlers. Think reconciles the declarations on startup,
stores a durable one-shot schedule for the next occurrence, and re-arms the next
occurrence after each run.

```typescript
import { Think, defineScheduledTasks } from "@cloudflare/think";

export class DigestAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getDefaultTimezone() {
    return "Europe/London";
  }

  getScheduledTasks() {
    return defineScheduledTasks({
      weeklyCommitReport: {
        schedule: "every week on monday at 09:00",
        prompt:
          "Compile all my GitHub commits for the last week and send a concise summary."
      },
      workout: {
        schedule: "every day at 08:00 in Europe/London",
        prompt: "Start my workout."
      },
      customerDigest: {
        schedule: "every day at 09:00",
        timezone: "America/New_York",
        metadata: { workflowName: "customer-digest" },
        retry: { maxAttempts: 3 },
        handler: async ({
          idempotencyKey,
          scheduledFor,
          scheduleKind,
          timezone
        }) => {
          await this.env.DIGEST_WORKFLOW.create({
            id: idempotencyKey,
            params: { scheduledFor, scheduleKind, timezone }
          });
        }
      }
    });
  }
}
```

The DSL supports `every <n> minutes`, `every <n> hours`,
`every day at HH:mm`, `every weekday at HH:mm`, and
`every week on monday,wednesday at HH:mm`. Wall-clock schedules require either
an inline timezone, a task `timezone`, or `getDefaultTimezone()`. If an alarm is
late, Think runs the intended occurrence once and schedules the next future
occurrence; it does not backfill missed runs.

Each task must define exactly one of `prompt` or `handler`. Prompt tasks create a
durable submission with `submitMessages()`. Handler tasks receive
`{ taskId, scheduledFor, scheduledForDate, occurrenceKey, idempotencyKey,
schedule, scheduleKind, timezone, metadata }` and are intended for app-owned
work such as creating a Workflow run or writing a run ledger. Delivery is
at-least-once; use `idempotencyKey` or `occurrenceKey` for your own durable
idempotency.

Static declarations reconcile on startup. If `getScheduledTasks()` reads
product-owned data that can change while the Durable Object is live, call
`internal_reconcileScheduledTasks()` after updating that data. During
reconciliation Think records the task row before creating the underlying Agent
schedule, so a missing `schedule_id` is only a pending reconcile state and is
repaired on the next reconcile. The task `retry` option retries the prompt or
handler action before the failure is logged. The next occurrence is still
scheduled after the action succeeds or exhausts its retries, so failed
occurrences do not block future runs.

## Session Integration

Think uses [Session](../sessions.md) for conversation storage. Override `configureSession` to add persistent memory, compaction, search, and skills:

```typescript
import { Think, Session } from "@cloudflare/think";

export class MyAgent extends Think<Env> {
  getModel() {
    /* ... */
  }

  configureSession(session: Session) {
    return session
      .withContext("soul", {
        provider: { get: async () => "You are a helpful coding assistant." }
      })
      .withContext("memory", {
        description: "Important facts learned during conversation.",
        maxTokens: 2000
      })
      .withCachedPrompt();
  }
}
```

Think's `this.messages` getter reads directly from Session's tree-structured storage. Context blocks, compaction overlays, and search are all handled by Session. See the [Sessions documentation](../sessions.md) for the full API.

[`agents/skills`](../../packages/agents/AGENTS.md) (so skill scripts pull
`@cloudflare/worker-bundler` and `just-bash` through `agents`, not Think).
