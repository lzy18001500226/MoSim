# OpenCode Model Gauntlet Results

Generated: 2026-05-20T15:44:19.975Z

Runs per model: 1
Recommended threshold: average >= 80, successful runs >= 1, consistency >= 85, hard failures = 0

Provider-infra runs are reported separately and are not counted as model behavior. They still block a Recommended verdict until rerun succeeds.

Scoring weights: launchBootstrap=15, directReply=10, peerRelayAB=15, peerRelayBC=15, concurrentReplies=15, taskRefs=10, cleanTranscript=10, noDuplicateTokens=5, latencyStable=5.
