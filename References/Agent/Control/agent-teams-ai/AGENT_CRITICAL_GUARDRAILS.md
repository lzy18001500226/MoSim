# Agent Critical Guardrails

These are the hard rules to keep agent work predictable and safe in this repo.

- Read `CLAUDE.md` first, then follow `docs/FEATURE_ARCHITECTURE_STANDARD.md` for new medium and large features.
- Use `pnpm` for project commands. Do not switch to `npm` or `yarn`.
- Use the desktop Electron app (`pnpm dev`) for normal local development and smoke checks unless browser-mode internals are explicitly requested.
- Do not run `pnpm lint:fix` unless the user explicitly asks for broad formatting changes.
- Keep main, preload, renderer, and shared responsibilities separate.
- Use `wrapAgentBlock(text)` instead of manually concatenating agent block markers.
- Preserve task/subagent filtering, structured task refs, and message parsing semantics.
- Validate IPC and other main-process inputs defensively and fail gracefully.
- Treat `docs/team-management/debugging-agent-teams.md` as the first stop for team launch hangs, bootstrap issues, or missing teammate replies.
- Do not revert unrelated user changes or other agents' edits.
