# Ask GUI Agent to start performing a new task on a connected device.

Ask the GUI agent to perform the specified task on a connected device.
The GUI Agent can be able to understand natural language instructions and interact with the device accordingly.
The agent will be able to execute a high-level task description，if you have any additional requirements, write them down in detail at tast string.
This function will reset the environment before executing the task, close current app, and back to home screen.

if you have

## The agent has the below limited capabilities:

1. The task must be related to an app that is already installed on the device. for example, "打开微信，帮我发一条消息给张三，说今天下午三点开会"; "帮我在淘宝上搜索一款性价比高的手机，并加入购物车"; "to purchase an ea on Amazon".

2. The task must be simple and specific. for example, "do yyy in xxx app"; "find xxx information in xxx app". ONE THING AT ONE APP AT A TIME.

3. The agent may not be able to handle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning or planning. for example. You may need to break down complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks and ask the agent to perform them sequentially. For example, instead of asking the agent to "plan a trip to Paris for xxx", you can ask it to "search for flights to Paris on xxx app", "find hotels in Paris on xxx app", make the plan yourself and ask agent to "sent the plan to xxx via IM app like wechat".

4. The agent connot accept multimodal inputs now. if you want to provide additional information like screenshot captions, please include them in the task description.

## Usage guidance：

1. you should never directly ask an Agent to pay or order anything. If user want to make a purchase, you should ask agent to stop brfore ordering/paying, and let user to order/pay.

2. tell the agent, if human verification is appeared during the task execution, the agent should ask Client. when the you see the INFO, you should ask user to handle the verification manually. after user says "done", you can continue the task with the session_id and device_id and ask the agent to continue in reply_from_client.

3. IF the last agentic call is failed or you want to perform a new task in different app, you should always use this function to start a new task, so that the environment will be reset before executing the task.

Returns:
    dict: Execution log containing details of the task execution.
    with keys including
        - device_info: Information about the device used for task execution.
        - final_action: The final action taken by the agent to complete the task.
        - global_step_idx: The total number of steps taken during the task execution.
        - local_step_idx: The number of steps taken in the current session.
        - session_id: The session ID for maintaining context across multiple tasks.
        - stop_reason: The reason for stopping the task execution (e.g., TASK_COMPLETED_SUCCESSFULLY).
        - task: The original task description provided to the agent.
