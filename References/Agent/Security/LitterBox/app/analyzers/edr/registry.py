"""Profile registry — single entry point for EDR-profile dispatch.

The Flask blueprints layer calls into this module rather than reaching into
profile.py / elastic_edr_analyzer.py directly. Three responsibilities:

  1. Load profiles at import time so the UI can list them.
  2. Dispatch a payload to a named profile and return the analyzer's results
     (full synchronous run — used by tests and CLI).
  3. Dispatch in split-phase mode: Phase 1 returns immediately, Phase 2
     (Elastic correlation) runs in a background thread and invokes a
     completion callback with the final result.

The registry is a module-level singleton — profiles are loaded once when
LitterBox boots. To pick up a new YAML, restart the app (consistent with
the rest of the analyzer config).
