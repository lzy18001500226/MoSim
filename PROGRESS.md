# Project Progress

> Current project memory for agent recovery. Keep this file short. Durable
> rules stay in `AGENTS.md`; detailed procedures stay in `workflows/`.

## Current Focus

- Current active goal: recover and solidify the 2026-05-20/21 user instruction
  ledger, establish main-thread and sub-agent goal/TaskSecretary coordination,
  and clarify Git plus parameter-identification next steps.
- Keep a `TaskSecretary` intake record for new user corrections, sub-agent
  terminal results, Git blockers, and manual-review decisions before promoting
  stable items to this file or the ledger.
- Current task/status review draft for user confirmation:
  `results/tmp/session_audit_20260521/task_status_review_20260521.md`.
  User reviewed it as broadly acceptable on 2026-05-21; promote stable items
  and keep it as the accepted task-state snapshot for this recovery round.
- Latest Git owner returned `DONE_WITH_CONCERNS`: docs checkpoint branch
  `git/full-convergence-docs-checkpoint-20260521` was pushed at
  `69bd26df44497153fd4eb731c5d03f811a9589e5`; the current local checkout is
  still an old polluted aggregate branch and must not be pushed as-is.
- Parameter identification next step is actionable workflow design: PX4 ULog,
  measured mass, motor order, ESC/RPM or thrust-stand data, and MWORKS parameter
  mapping. Do not stop at "current parameters are unreliable."

## Active Queues

| Queue | Owner Role | State | Next Safe Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current instruction recovery | `TaskSecretary` / main agent | accepted | User reviewed the task/status table as broadly acceptable; keep future corrections in TaskSecretary intake. |
| Git integration | `GitFullConvergenceOwner` | done-with-concerns | Use clean branches or `origin/main` for future Git work; do not push old polluted aggregate branches. |
| Cosys-AirSim smoke | `UEBuildSmokeRunner` | visually-reviewed | UE 5.5 Blocks UBT build passed and user confirmed the opened scene is okay; next task is deciding the control/API/UI integration route. |
| Agent workflow improvement | main agent + reviewers | awaiting-user-review | TaskSecretary/goal/Git-owner rules are promoted and `git diff --check` passed; next change should follow user review. |
| External docs learning | `ExternalDocsLearningOwner` | recurring-loop-defined | Use `docs/index/external_learning_index.md` and `workflows/agent_orchestration.md#71-recurring-learning-owner` when failures, new tools, new repos, or milestones trigger another learn-and-patch cycle. |
| Vehicle parameter identification | `VehicleParamIdentificationResearcher` | action-plan-defined-awaiting-data | Risk parameters and PX4-log/open-source identification route are promoted to `workflows/identify_quadrotor_parameters.md` and `Design/02/03/07`; next blocker is real `.ulg`/mass/motor-order/RPM or thrust data. |
| AirSim batch migration | `AirSimMigrationCoordinator` + `AirSimGitBatchOwner` | running | Source `C:\Users\HP\Desktop\AirSim` is approved only for read/copy into `references/AirSim`; `PEDRA` and workflow rules are pushed at `aadfb09bf`. Remaining batches must be delegated to child owners with child WAL/checkpoints. |

## Superseded Queues

| Queue | Previous Owner Role | State | Reason |
|---|---|---|---|
| RflySim scene review | `RflySimSceneReviewer` | superseded | User clarified RflySim maps are no longer the current priority. Do not resume unless explicitly requested. |

## Mistakes To Avoid

- Do not put live task state, long trigger phrases, or detailed mechanics into
  `AGENTS.md`.
- Do not mark a sub-agent task done just because one checkpoint succeeded.
- Do not close Git owner agents before the full push/integration stop condition.
- Do not batch-close agents. Record each agent's terminal checkpoint in the
  ledger/PROGRESS/WAL first, then close only that specific completed agent.
- Do not accept documentation updates without a docs-quality review pass.
- Do not claim agent/documentation tasks complete without fresh verification
  evidence from this turn or a recorded WAL terminal event.
- Do not accept external reviewer feedback blindly; evaluate it against project
  scope, permission boundaries, YAGNI, and source evidence first.
- Do not paste raw SSE/UI/PTY streams, provider configs, full prompts, secrets,
  or huge logs into durable docs. Record locators, hashes, sizes, and summaries.
- Do not trust chat memory for long tasks; recover from
  `workflows/agent_task_ledger.md` and `results/agent_runs/*/events.jsonl`.
- Do not treat UE/RflySim/SPEAR/Cosys repositories as equivalent; record exact
  simulator role and evidence before adopting assets.
- Do not accept a passing core library build as proof that a local Unreal
  environment builds; environment-local plugin copies can have missing
  dependencies.
- Do not commit local UE build libraries such as Blocks-local `AirLib.lib`
  when they exceed 100 MB; keep them as local build artifacts only.
- Do not chase `git/finalize-safe-batches-clean-20260521` as a single aggregate
  push; its content is covered by split branches and GitHub rejected the
  aggregate pack for exceeding 2 GiB.
- Do not reduce "continue tasks" to only the latest user-visible thread.
  Maintain a ledger-backed queue for Git, external learning, simulator bring-up,
  parameter identification, docs review, and mainline implementation.
- Do not open UE Editor when the requested review is a packaged simulator
  interface such as RflySim3D or CopterSim.
- Do not adopt Loopback/self-repeating driver loops, Composio credentialed
  workflows, global Codex agent installs, or OKWinds runtime services as project
  requirements unless the user explicitly asks for that integration.
- Do not treat a sub-agent checkpoint as completion when the assigned goal was
  broader than that checkpoint.
- Do not let user corrections stay only in chat. Add them to the current
  `TaskSecretary` intake and promote stable rules to durable docs after review.
- Do not conclude parameter identification with "parameters are wrong"; produce
  the data, log fields, estimator route, MWORKS mapping, and validation plan.
- Do not treat external docs/skills learning as a one-time task. Make it a
  recurring loop after repeated failures, new tool installs, major milestones,
  and sub-agent management incidents.
- Do not treat a temporary task/status table as final project truth until the
  user has reviewed it; promote only stable decisions to `PROGRESS.md`, ledger,
  or workflows.
- Do not migrate AirSim-scale external repositories as one aggregate Git
  operation. Use per-subproject batches, record exclusions, and verify
  >100 MB files, gitlinks, LFS pointers, generated artifacts, and secrets
  before every commit.
- Do not let the main agent become the long-running worker for large migration
  or Git streams. Main agent is the director: keep ledger/PROGRESS current,
  assign child-owner queues, review returned evidence, and integrate/push only
  after batch gates pass.
