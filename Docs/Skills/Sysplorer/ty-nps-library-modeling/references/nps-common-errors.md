## 1. Parameter and Syntax Issues

### String parameters are written without quotes

Symptoms:

- Translation fails on record or text-like parameters.
- Parameter assignment looks visually correct but Sysplorer rejects it.

Checks:

- Confirm whether the target parameter is a string or enumeration-like text input.
- Add quotes exactly where the model expects text input.

### Repeated iteration happens without understanding the component first

Symptoms:

- The model is repeatedly rewired or retuned, but the root cause remains unverified.
- A component's pin mapping, rotation effect, internal structure, or parameter meaning is still unclear.
- Full-model iterations continue before any minimal local validation is done.

Checks:

- Stop further full-model edits until the uncertain component behavior is inspected.
- Read the component documentation, class description, and interface definition first.
- Build a minimal validation model for the uncertain component or local subcircuit before returning to the full system.

### Experiment or configuration keys use the wrong spelling or case

Symptoms:

- Simulation settings appear ignored.
- The model runs with unexpected defaults.

Checks:

- Verify exact parameter names and casing for experiment dictionaries or configuration records.
- Do not assume uppercase and lowercase are interchangeable.

### Non-editable parameters are assigned directly

Symptoms:

- Translation fails or the model rejects assignments.
- The parameter is visible in text but not meant to be edited externally.

Checks:

- Confirm whether the parameter is editable in the component definition.
- If not editable, change the correct exposed parameter or use a different component configuration path.

## 2. Connection and Interface Issues

### Single-phase and three-phase interfaces are connected incorrectly

Symptoms:

- Port-domain mismatch in check or translate.
- A model compiles only after unsafe edits to unrelated equations.

Checks:

- Verify connector type and phase count on both sides.
- Use official conversion blocks such as `PlugToPin_p` or `PlugToPins_p` when needed.
- Verify whether the ports are one-dimensional versus three-dimensional, or scalar versus vector interfaces.
- Do not work around this error by deleting the connected component or editing unrelated equations first.

### Ground or reference is missing or duplicated

Symptoms:

- Floating nodes, abnormal voltages, unstable currents, or failed initialization.

Checks:

- Ensure each isolated electrical island has a valid reference.
- For isolated transformer primary and secondary sides, verify whether both sides need their own reference.
- Do not add duplicate grounds if a subsystem already contains an internal reference.
- In electrical fault diagnosis, check this item first before deeper parameter tuning or topology replacement.

### The model is structurally connected but diagram review is impossible

Symptoms:

- `check` passes, but exported diagrams are unreadable.
- Important lines overlap or are invisible.
- A text-connected model cannot be reliably continued from the GUI workflow.
- A later text edit changes wiring after an earlier diagram review, so the review evidence is stale.
- Electrical interface lines appear black without a clear library-specific reason.
- The model reached `check` or later stages even though graphical construction was bypassed by direct full-model text injection.

Checks:

- Add or repair `Placement(...)` and `Line(points=...)` annotations.
- Confirm the model still contains `Diagram(coordinateSystem(...))`.
- Export the diagram once before accepting the build.
- If text `connect(...)` was added without a matching `Line(points=...)`, treat the diagram as incomplete even if check passes.
- If the task required graphical modeling, verify whether GUI-side placement and wiring were preserved instead of silently falling back to text-only edits.
- If wiring changed after the last review, redo the review from the latest model state instead of trusting the old evidence.
- For black electrical lines, check whether explicit `color={0,0,255}` is missing or overwritten; only keep black when the library convention is documented and intentional.
- If GUI construction was bypassed by `SetModelText`, `SetModelCode`, or direct full-model text injection, treat the current build as failed graphical modeling and return to the graphical repair path.

## 3. Translation and Initialization Issues

### Equation imbalance or structural singularity

Symptoms:

- Translation fails with underdetermined or overdetermined system messages.

Checks:

- Re-check missing support blocks such as `Powergui`, references, measurement reference points, or boundary conditions.
- Re-check `Ground / Reference` placement as the first required item, including duplicated grounds and wrong-side grounding on isolated sections.
- Re-check unconnected ports, duplicate connections, wrong connection direction, and interface dimension mismatch before touching topology.
- Remove duplicate or conflicting constraints only after connection and interface issues have been ruled out.

### Discrete control and continuous circuit initialization conflict

Symptoms:

- Translation or initialization fails around controller states, PWM, or sampled blocks.

Checks:

- Re-check the relationship among switching period, sampling period, and control period.
- Start from the default discrete baseline before introducing mixed-mode complexity.

### Load-flow initialization is incomplete

Symptoms:

- Load-flow models fail before time-domain simulation starts.

Checks:

- Confirm `Powergui`, `LoadFlowBus`, and slack or control node roles are present and consistent.
- Re-check P/Q settings, base voltage, and transformer connection mode.

## 4. Simulation Setup Issues

### Step size is too large for the fastest relevant period

Symptoms:

- Severe ripple distortion, aliasing, false oscillation, or unstable controller behavior.

Checks:

- Start from `step <= T/10`, where `T` is the fastest relevant switching or sampling period.
- If deviating from this rule, record the reason explicitly.

### Solver choice is inconsistent with the model family

Symptoms:

- Switching model results look non-physical or extremely noisy.

Checks:

- For switching, PWM, and PLL-heavy models, start from a discrete baseline with inline implicit Euler.
- Change solver only after documenting why the default baseline is insufficient.

## 5. Result Readback and Verification Issues

### Result variable is queried before confirming it exists

Symptoms:

- Result readback fails or returns empty data.

Checks:

- Confirm the exact variable name first.
- Probe availability before bulk result extraction.

### Verification conclusion is given without minimum evidence

Symptoms:

- The report says "correct" without key variables, settings, or figures.

Checks:

- Include solver, step size, key observables, and acceptance grade.
- Follow `references/acceptance-checklist.md` and `references/input-output-contract.md`.

## 6. Diagram and Delivery Issues

### Only technical success is reported, but no delivery evidence is packaged

Symptoms:

- The model runs, but there is no final report, no acceptance level, and no diagram review result.

Checks:

- Package the result with `templates/acceptance-report-template.md`.
- Include diagram review, successful tool actions, solver and step evidence, and known limitations.
